# Todo Site
This is a fully functioning Todo site. It features fully working authentication system, creating, viewing, updating and deleting your Tasks (todos).<br>
<br>
The site is using my Auth-system app that I developed. You can find it [here](https://github.com/mirokrastev/django-projects/tree/master/Authentication%20System)<br>
<br>
The front end can be massively improved and I will keep an eye on this sector.<br>
<hr>
The Database is empty, so if you want to use the site you need to create an account.<br>
You can access the admin page, but you need to create a superuser account from the terminal.
