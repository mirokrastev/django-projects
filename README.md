# django-projects
Small, one-off test sites, built with Django. They are nothing special, just some small encapsulated functionality.
<br>
Check each project's folder for additional ```README```<br>
## Note
In this repo, I upload every project that I start. When the project has grown enough, I split the subfolder out into a new repo. Some "projects" are meant to be one-off test sites.
