# django-projects
Small, one-off test sites, built with Django. They are nothing special, just some small encapsulated functionality.

Check each project's folder for additional ```README```<br>
## Note
I've been developoing ```Poll System``` for some time now, and it's almost ready to be transfered in it's own repo.
