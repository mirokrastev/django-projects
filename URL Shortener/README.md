# URL Shortener

A small website that shortens urls. To use it, you do not need accounts or anything.<br>
Just enter the full url and you can specify your custom "Alias" to associate the url to it.

To redirect, just go to ```/url/<alias>```<br>
<br>
If Alias is not specified in the form, it will be auto generated for you!
