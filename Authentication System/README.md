# Auth-System
This is a basic Auth System.<br>
<br>
The HTML pages are blank, with navbar to register, login and logout. It should be easy to integrate the app ```register``` into other projects.<br>
<hr>
The Database is empty, so if you want to enter the admin page, you need to create a superuser account from the terminal.
